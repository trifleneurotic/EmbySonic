*As of today (7-Feb-2026), sadly, I am archiving this project. It was (and I think still is) a good idea, and it grew out of my desire a while back to use the Android app [DSub](https://github.com/daneren2005/Subsonic) with Emby. But since then some great apps have been released that natively leverage Emby's APIs (and I've been happily using [Symfonium](https://symfonium.app/) for a while now), although music apps likely wouldn't be the only use case for a piece of software such as EmbySonic. With that said though, my original use case has heretofore been satisfied by other apps, and I am wanting to turn my focus towards other projects. Please feel free to fork this project if you'd like to take it to the next level.*

EmbySonic aims to be a plugin for Emby that extends Emby's native API to add a Subsonic-compatible calling layer.

Please refer to license for any questions on modification, distribution, or liability. Use at your own risk.

Installation steps will depend on the platform you currently use for your Emby server, but at a high level, you will simply need to:

1. Shut down your Emby server.
2. Copy the `.dll` assembly to your Emby server's `plugins` directory.
3. Start up your Emby server.

At this time, any future releases will all be pre-release, so don't be surprised at this stage if it does not function properly, or function whatsoever. That said, feel free to open an issue to make sure something is tracked & eventually addressed.

Also planned for the README is some kind of chart or other visual that will show API implementation progress/percentages.

Cheers!
