# EmbySonic
![EmbySonic logo](Images/plugin.png)


EmbySonic aims to be a plugin for Emby that extends Emby's native API to add a Subsonic-compatible calling layer.

Please refer to license for any questions on modification, distribution, or liability. Use at your own risk.

Installation steps will depend on the platform you currently use for your Emby server, but at a high level, you will simply need to:

1. Shut down your Emby server.
2. Copy the `.dll` assembly to your Emby server's `plugins` directory.
3. Start up your Emby server.

At this time, any future releases will all be pre-release, so don't be surprised at this stage if it does not function properly, or function whatsoever. That said, feel free to open an issue to make sure something is tracked & eventually addressed.

Also planned for the README is some kind of chart or other visual that will show API implementation progress/percentages.

Cheers!
